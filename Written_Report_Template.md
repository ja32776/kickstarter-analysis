# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this Project is to Identify, Summarize, and Visualize trends in the Kickstarter File. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was produced by following the instructions provided on Canvas. 

It was a challenge getting the "COUNTIF" formulas correct. Simple things like  (<45000) vs. (<=45000) make a difference. Also, trying to work more efficiently (i.e,  dragging the Bottom-Right corner of  the cell to replicate the Formula to the rest of the cells in that column/row), can cause problems if you aren't careful with the Cells (Some cells need to be locked, other cells need to be left open to change. Sometimes the Column needs to be locked, while the Row is free, etc.  ) ; Example: =D7/$E7.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There was a steady rise in Successful kickstarters between January and June (peaking around 11), then there was a sharp drop; no Month exceeding 5 successful Kickstarters for the rest of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The kickstarters with Lower goals had a good success rate (80%), then there was a steady decline to a 20% success rate For the kickstarters that had $25000 to $29999 as a goal. The success rate then went back up to about 65% for fundraising raising $35000 to $44999 , followed by another sharp decline.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset could contain more information. We could perhaps keep track of the donations of each Backer. We know that the pledged / Backer gives us the average donation for each Kickstarter, but it'd be interesting to derive other stats like the Minimum /Maximum donation of a Backer, etc. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A stacked Column chart (and a 100% Stacked Column Chart) could help visualize the proportions of Success/Failed/Canceled kickstarters
A Column chart analyzing the success rate of the different Parent Categories would be very informative.
